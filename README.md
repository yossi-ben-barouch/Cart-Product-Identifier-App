# Cart-Product-Identifier-App ðŸ›’

Cart-Product-Identifier-App based on CartAPP is an experimental learning application that allows users to take a picture with their phone, send the image to a backend API that queries an image processing model (such as OpenAI GPT-4), and receive an identification of the item in the picture along with its average price. 
This project serves as a learning exercise brought to us by @camilasandovals in our recent FloridaJS meetup (08/06/2024) to understand React Native, camera integration, and API interactions.

## Features

- **Camera Integration**: Users can take pictures using their phone's camera.
- **Image Upload**: The captured image is sent to a backend API for processing.
- **Item Identification**: The backend API processes the image and returns the identified item and its average price.
- **Shopping List**: Users can add identified items to their shopping list and view the total price.
- **Confirmation Modals**: Users receive confirmation prompts before adding or deleting items from the shopping list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
